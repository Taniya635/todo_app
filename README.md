##Project Scope and Goals:
The goal of the project is to create a simple web-based Todo App that allows users to add, update, and delete tasks. The app will help users keep track of their tasks and prioritize them based on their importance.

##Key Features:
Task List Display: The app will display a list of tasks that users have added. Each task will include a title and priority level.
Add Task: Users can add new tasks to the list by entering a title and selecting a priority level (e.g., low, medium, high).
Edit Task: Users can edit existing tasks to modify their title or priority level.
Delete Task: Users can remove tasks from the list.
Priority Color Coding: Tasks will be color-coded based on their priority level, making it visually clear which tasks are more important.
Responsive Design: The app will be responsive and work well on various screen sizes, including desktop and mobile.

##Technical Implementation:
For a two-day project, you might use a frontend stack that includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a brief overview of the technical implementation:
1. Project Setup:
  Create a new React app using a tool like create-react-app.
  Install necessary dependencies, including react-router-dom for routing and axios for making HTTP requests to the JSON server.
2. CSS: Style the app to make it visually appealing. Apply styles to the task list, input fields, buttons, and priority color coding.
3. JSON Server Setup:
   Set up a JSON server to act as a backend for storing tasks.
   Define a basic JSON file with an array of tasks as a starting point.
4. Responsive Design: Apply responsive CSS styles to ensure the app looks good and functions properly on different devices.

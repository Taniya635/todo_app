<h2>Project Scope and Goals:</h2>
The goal of the project is to create a simple web-based Todo App that allows users to add, update, and delete tasks. The app will help users keep track of their tasks and prioritize them based on their importance.

<h2>Key Features:</h2>
<h4>Task List Display:</h4> The app will display a list of tasks that users have added. Each task will include a title and priority level. <br/>
<h4>Add Task:</h4> Users can add new tasks to the list by entering a title and selecting a priority level (e.g., low, medium, high). <br/>
<h4>Edit Task:</h4> Users can edit existing tasks to modify their title or priority level. <br/>
<h4>Delete Task:</h4> Users can remove tasks from the list. <br/>
<h4>Priority Color Coding:</h4> Tasks will be color-coded based on their priority level, making it visually clear which tasks are more important. <br/>
<h4>Responsive Design:</h4> The app will be responsive and work well on various screen sizes, including desktop and mobile. <br/>
 
<h2>Technical Implementation:</h2>
For a two-day project, you might use a frontend stack that includes reactjs, CSS, and json server. Here's a brief overview of the technical implementation: <br/>
<ol>
  <li> <h4>Project Setup:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a new React app using a tool like create-react-app. <br/></li>
    <li>Install necessary dependencies, including react-router-dom for routing and axios for making HTTP requests to the JSON server. <br/></li>
  </ul></li>

<li><h4>CSS:</h4> Style the app to make it visually appealing. Apply styles to the task list, input fields, buttons, and priority color coding. <br/></li>

<li>
  <h4>JSON Server Setup:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Set up a JSON server to act as a backend for storing tasks. <br/></li>
  <li>Define a basic JSON file with an array of tasks as a starting point. <br/></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><h4>Responsive Design:</h4> Apply responsive CSS styles to ensure the app looks good and functions properly on different devices. <br/>
</li>
</ol>
